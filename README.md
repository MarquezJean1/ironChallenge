The domain structure, infrastructure, and controller were created.
The Phone class was created to store the data contained in each button.
In the programming logic, the first attempt was to group the characters and count them to reduce code, but it turned out that doing so generated an error when all the characters were close together, so it was replaced with a traditional foreach function.
Then, the values ​​were iterated, obtaining the letter positions. If the value is greater than allowed, it is assumed to be a new letter.
In the unit tests, only examples of different ways the string can arrive are provided.
In item 2, there is an error: it is 'BP', not 'B'.
Thank you for your attention.
